## Thank you script for Windows

1. Write whatever message you would like in the thank you script
2. Drag and drop the script onto the obfuscater.  This will encode the characters to Chinese making the script unreadable for most of us.
3. Rename the script to something less obvious
4. Email your favorite engineer and ask them to debug the script
